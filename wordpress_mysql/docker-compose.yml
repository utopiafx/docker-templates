      # This is only for development mode, when wanna change files in the wordpress or themes etc
      # from start!, in other cases, you have already editor inside wp-admin and
      # all you need for adding themes, add plugins etc. And you could of course in live-production
      # even setup a FTP inside the container if needed. Not recommended, but still.
      # the best practice would perhaps be to work local container first and then rebuild the image
      # and push it up, when changings files in wordpress like this one, or 
      # using the CMS for it.
