# Docker-Templates

Contain examples for different basic container case, that could be useful when building a project from scratch and
quickly need a setup to continue with instead of inventing the wheel again.


# Details

How I use it in my project is to write a shellscript command
that takes a copy of the templates I needed and then
setups all those basic things you need for start up.

If only need a totally blank setup without any particular image
you could use "blank" or simple write it for yourself, its
basically extreme clean and simple template.

But if you need one of those templates, better to install that first.

And as you could see, some of them has a prebuilded setup
for an example of chat-socket communication, another one is for 
loadbalancer, another for wordpress, third is for setting up
a simple basic website, another one is for instance for Todo-list,
and so on.
